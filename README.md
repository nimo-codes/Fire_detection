# Fire_detection
This is a Machine Learning algorithm trained on random forest classifier which is a classification based algorithm to detect if the fire is goin to take place or not. the Accuracy of this model is 100%.

I used 3 different algorithms- SVC,Randomforestclasifier and Naive bayes. Out of which Randomforest classifier performed the best.
